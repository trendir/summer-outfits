Patagonia offers a range of clothing and accessories that are both functional and sustainable, including jackets, backpacks, and hats. Their target audience is primarily hikers, climbers, and anyone who enjoys spending time in nature.

Many buyers are looking for a specific cut or wash that may no longer be available in stores, and are willing to pay a premium for a gently used pair. </p><p><h4>Patagonia</h4></p><p>For the outdoorsy and environmentally conscious man, Patagonia is a popular brand on Poshmark.
