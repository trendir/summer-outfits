They should also have a welcoming atmosphere and friendly staff.</p><p>Q: What should I order at a coffee shop?</p><p>A: It depends on your personal preferences. If you like strong coffee, try an espresso or Americano. If you prefer something sweeter, try a latte or cappuccino. Don't be afraid to ask the barista for recommendations!</p><p>Q: Are local coffee shops more expensive than chain coffee shops?</p><p>A: Not necessarily. While some local coffee shops may be more expensive, others may offer prices comparable to chain coffee shops.
