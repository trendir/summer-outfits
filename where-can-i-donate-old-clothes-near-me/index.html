The shelter staff was friendly and grateful, and I left feeling like I had made a positive impact on someone's life.</p><p><h3>Donating to National Organizations</h3></p><p>If you prefer to donate to a larger organization, there are many national options available. The Salvation Army and Goodwill are two of the largest organizations that accept clothing donations. They have donation centers all over the country, making it easy to find a location near you.</p><p>When donating to a national organization, it's important to do your research. Make sure that the organization you choose has a good reputation and that your clothes will go to people in need.</p><p><h4>How to Prepare Your Clothes for Donation</h4></p><p>Before you donate your old clothes, it's important to prepare them properly. This means washing and drying them, folding them neatly, and putting them in a bag or box. You should also make sure that the clothes are in good condition and free of any stains or tears.</p><p>By preparing your clothes properly, you can ensure that they will be in good condition for the people who receive them.
