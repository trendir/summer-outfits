Each shirt is made by hand, with skilled artisans taking hours to stitch each piece together. The attention to detail is unparalleled, with even the buttons being hand-sewn onto the shirt.</p><h2>3. Turnbull & Asser</h2><p>Turnbull & Asser is a British shirtmaker founded in 1885. Their shirts are known for their classic style and attention to detail. Each shirt is made by hand and can take up to four weeks to complete. I have had the pleasure of owning a Turnbull & Asser shirt and the fit and comfort are unmatched.</p><h2>4. Charvet</h2><p>Charvet is a French luxury shirtmaker founded in 1838. They are known for their use of high-quality materials and their attention to detail.
