You want to keep the focus on the dress, so choose simple pieces that complement it. A pair of gold or silver hoop earrings and a delicate necklace are perfect for adding a touch of elegance to your look.</p><p>For a more casual look, consider adding a belt to cinch in your waist and create a more defined silhouette. A denim jacket or leather jacket is also a great option for adding some edge to your outfit.</p><p><h2>Choosing Footwear for Your Vintage Kookai Dress</h2></p><p>When it comes to footwear, the options are endless. For a dressier look, opt for a pair of strappy heels or classic pumps. If you're going for a more casual vibe, a pair of ankle boots or sneakers will do the trick.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind when choosing footwear is the length of your dress. If you're wearing a shorter vintage Kookai dress, make sure your shoes don't cut you off at the ankle. If you're wearing a longer dress, make sure your shoes aren't too chunky and overpower the dress.</p><p><h3>Styling Your Hair and Makeup</h3></p><p>When it comes to hair and makeup, you want to keep it simple and natural. A messy bun or loose waves are perfect for adding a touch of effortless elegance to your look. As for makeup, a natural, dewy look is best.
