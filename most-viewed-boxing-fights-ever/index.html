Whether you are a longtime fan or just starting to explore the world of boxing, it can be helpful to have a list of the most viewed boxing fights ever to guide your viewing choices.So, what are the most viewed boxing fights ever? The answer to that question depends on a variety of factors, including the era in which the fight took place, the boxers involved, and the stakes of the match. However, there are a few fights that stand out as some of the most memorable and iconic in boxing history.Some of the most viewed boxing fights ever include the &#34;Fight of the Century&#34; between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, the &#34;Thrilla in Manila&#34; between Ali and Frazier, the &#34;Rumble in the Jungle&#34; between Ali and George Foreman, and the &#34;Brawl in Montreal&#34; between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran.The &#34;Fight of the Century&#34;The &#34;Fight of the Century&#34; between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier took place on March 8, 1971, and was one of the most highly anticipated boxing matches of all time. Ali was returning to the ring after being stripped of his title for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam War, and Frazier was the undisputed heavyweight champion. The fight was a back-and-forth battle, with both boxers delivering punishing blows throughout the 15 rounds. In the end, Frazier won by unanimous decision, cementing his place as one of the greatest boxers of all time.The &#34;Thrilla in Manila&#34;The &#34;Thrilla in Manila&#34; between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier took place on October 1, 1975, and is widely considered one of the greatest boxing matches in history. The two boxers had already fought twice before, with Frazier winning the first match and Ali winning the second.

The second fight was a much different affair, with Leonard using his speed and footwork to frustrate Duran and avoid his punches. In the eighth round, Duran famously turned to the referee and said &#34;no mas,&#34; signaling that he had had enough and was quitting the fight.

Over the years, there have been many legendary boxing matches that have captivated audiences and left lasting impressions. In this guide, we will explore the most viewed boxing fights ever and what makes them so special.</p><p>Boxing fans are always looking for the best fights to watch, and it can be overwhelming to sift through the countless options available. Whether you are a longtime fan or just starting to explore the world of boxing, it can be helpful to have a list of the most viewed boxing fights ever to guide your viewing choices.</p><p>So, what are the most viewed boxing fights ever? The answer to that question depends on a variety of factors, including the era in which the fight took place, the boxers involved, and the stakes of the match. However, there are a few fights that stand out as some of the most memorable and iconic in boxing history.</p><p>Some of the most viewed boxing fights ever include the "Fight of the Century" between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, the "Thrilla in Manila" between Ali and Frazier, the "Rumble in the Jungle" between Ali and George Foreman, and the "Brawl in Montreal" between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran.</p><h2>The "Fight of the Century"</h2><p>The "Fight of the Century" between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier took place on March 8, 1971, and was one of the most highly anticipated boxing matches of all time. Ali was returning to the ring after being stripped of his title for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam War, and Frazier was the undisputed heavyweight champion. The fight was a back-and-forth battle, with both boxers delivering punishing blows throughout the 15 rounds. In the end, Frazier won by unanimous decision, cementing his place as one of the greatest boxers of all time.</p><h2>The "Thrilla in Manila"</h2><p>The "Thrilla in Manila" between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier took place on October 1, 1975, and is widely considered one of the greatest boxing matches in history. The two boxers had already fought twice before, with Frazier winning the first match and Ali winning the second. The "Thrilla in Manila" was the rubber match, and both men were determined to come out on top. The fight was grueling, with both boxers taking and delivering massive amounts of punishment. In the end, Ali won by TKO in the 14th round, but both men left the ring with newfound respect for each other.</p><h3>The "Rumble in the Jungle"</h3><p>The "Rumble in the Jungle" between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman took place on October 30, 1974, in Kinshasa, Zaire. The fight was historic for a number of reasons, including the fact that it was held in Africa and was one of the first major international sporting events to be televised live around the world. Ali was considered the underdog going into the fight, but he used his famous "rope-a-dope" strategy to tire Foreman out and then knocked him out in the eighth round.</p><h4>The "Brawl in Montreal"</h4><p>The "Brawl in Montreal" between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran took place on June 20, 1980, and was a rematch of their first fight, which Duran had won by unanimous decision. The second fight was a much different affair, with Leonard using his speed and footwork to frustrate Duran and avoid his punches. In the eighth round, Duran famously turned to the referee and said "no mas," signaling that he had had enough and was quitting the fight. The "Brawl in Montreal" remains one of the most controversial fights in boxing history.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: What makes these fights so special?</strong></p><p>A: These fights are special because they feature some of the greatest boxers of all time competing at the highest level. They also have a sense of drama and history that make them more than just sporting events.</p><p><strong>Q: Are there any other notable boxing matches that didn't make the list?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely! There have been countless memorable boxing matches throughout history, and this list is by no means exhaustive. Some other notable fights include the "Fight of the Year" between Arturo Gatti and Micky Ward and the "Golden Boy" Oscar De La Hoya's matches against Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao.</p><p><strong>Q: What impact have these fights had on the sport of boxing?</strong></p><p>A: These fights have had a huge impact on the sport of boxing, both in terms of their historical significance and their influence on future generations of boxers. Many of these fights are still talked about and analyzed by boxing fans and experts today.</p><p><strong>Q: Where can I watch these fights?</strong></p><p>A: Many of these fights are available on various streaming services or can be purchased on DVD. Check with your local video store or online retailers to see what options are available.</p><h2>Conclusion of Most Viewed Boxing Fights Ever</h2><p>Boxing has a rich history filled with legendary matches and iconic moments. The most viewed boxing fights ever are a testament to the sport's enduring popularity and the incredible feats of athleticism and skill displayed by its greatest champions. Whether you are a die-hard fan or just starting to explore the world of boxing, these fights are a must-see for anyone who loves sports and competition.</p></article>
