Running is one of the most popular forms of exercise, and it is important to have the right shoes to prevent injuries and ensure a comfortable experience. With so many options available in the market, it can be overwhelming to choose the perfect pair. We have done the research for you and narrowed down the top picks that are both affordable and high-quality.</p><p>Running shoes are designed to support your feet and absorb shock while running on various surfaces. Choosing the wrong pair of shoes can lead to discomfort, pain, and even injuries such as shin splints or plantar fasciitis. It is important to consider factors such as the type of terrain you will be running on, your foot shape and arch, and your personal preferences when selecting the perfect pair of running shoes.</p><p>If you are looking for the best running shoes in India under 10000, our top pick is the ASICS Gel-Contend 6. This shoe provides excellent cushioning and support, making it ideal for beginners and experienced runners alike. It also has a breathable mesh upper that keeps your feet cool and comfortable during long runs. Other great options include Nike Revolution 5, Reebok Dart XT, and Puma Speed 300 Racer.</p><h2>ASICS Gel-Contend 6</h2><p>Personally, I have been using the ASICS Gel-Contend 6 for over a year now and it has been an excellent investment. The shoe has a comfortable fit and provides ample support for my high arches. I have used it for both road and trail running and it has held up well on both surfaces. The Gel technology in the sole provides great shock absorption, which is especially important for me as I tend to land on my heels while running. Overall, I highly recommend the ASICS Gel-Contend 6 for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable pair of running shoes.</p><h2>Nike Revolution 5</h2><p>The Nike Revolution 5 is another great option that is both stylish and functional. It has a lightweight design that makes it ideal for faster runs, and the soft foam midsole provides excellent cushioning. The shoe also has a breathable mesh upper that keeps your feet cool and dry. The only downside is that it may not be suitable for runners with wider feet, as it can be a bit narrow in the toe box.</p><h3>Reebok Dart XT</h3><p>The Reebok Dart XT is a versatile shoe that can be used for both running and cross-training. It has a durable rubber outsole that provides good traction on various surfaces, and the EVA foam midsole offers comfortable cushioning. The shoe also has a breathable mesh upper that allows for good airflow. However, some users have reported that the sizing can be inconsistent, so it may be worth trying on a few different sizes before making a purchase.</p><h4>Puma Speed 300 Racer</h4><p>The Puma Speed 300 Racer is a lightweight shoe that is designed for speed. It has a responsive foam midsole that provides good energy return, and the carbon rubber outsole offers good traction on both wet and dry surfaces. The shoe also has a seamless upper that reduces irritation and chafing. However, some users have reported that the sizing can be a bit small, so it may be worth ordering a half size up.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>Q: What should I consider when choosing running shoes?</h3><p>A: When choosing running shoes, you should consider factors such as the type of terrain you will be running on, your foot shape and arch, and your personal preferences. It is also important to try on different sizes and styles to find the perfect fit.</p><h3>Q: How often should I replace my running shoes?</h3><p>A: It is recommended to replace your running shoes every 300-500 miles, or every 6-8 months, whichever comes first. This is because the cushioning and support in the shoes can wear out over time, which can lead to discomfort and injuries.</p><h3>Q: Can I use running shoes for other forms of exercise?</h3><p>A: While running shoes are designed specifically for running, they can also be used for other forms of exercise such as walking or cross-training. However, it is important to note that different forms of exercise may require different types of support and cushioning, so it may be worth investing in specific shoes for each activity.</p><h3>Q: What is the best way to break in new running shoes?</h3><p>A: The best way to break in new running shoes is to start by wearing them for short periods of time, such as during a warm-up or cool-down. Gradually increase the amount of time you wear them over the course of a few weeks. It is also important to listen to your body and adjust the fit or style of the shoes if they are causing discomfort.</p><h2>Conclusion of best running shoes in India under 10000</h2><p>Choosing the perfect pair of running shoes can make all the difference in your running experience. By considering factors such as terrain, foot shape, and personal preferences, you can find the perfect pair that meets your needs. Our top picks for the best running shoes in India under 10000 include the ASICS Gel-Contend 6, Nike Revolution 5, Reebok Dart XT, and Puma Speed 300 Racer. These shoes offer excellent support, cushioning, and durability at an affordable price point.</p></article>
