It can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion, and it can be styled in a variety of different ways.</p><p>For a casual daytime look, you can pair a simple cotton kurta with jeans or leggings and sandals. For a more formal occasion, you can choose a silk or embroidered kurta and wear it with dress pants or a long skirt.</p><h2>Conclusion of What is an Indian Robe Called</h2><p>In conclusion, the traditional Indian robe is known as a kurta, and it is a versatile and timeless garment that is worn by both men and women.
