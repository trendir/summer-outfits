Always read the care label before washing or cleaning vintage clothing, and avoid using harsh detergents or bleach.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I sell my vintage clothing to vintage fashion stores in Australia?</strong></p><p>A: Some vintage fashion stores in Australia may buy vintage clothing from individuals, but it's best to check with the store first to see if they're interested.
