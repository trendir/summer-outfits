It is a sport that has captured the hearts of millions of people around the world. However, boxing is not just about skill and technique, it is also about size. In this article, we will be discussing the biggest boxers in the world and how their size gives them an edge in the ring.</p><p>When it comes to boxing, size matters. A bigger boxer has a longer reach, more power, and can absorb more punishment. However, being big also has its drawbacks. Bigger boxers tend to be slower and less agile than their smaller counterparts, making them vulnerable to faster opponents. Additionally, being big can also take a toll on a boxer's stamina, making it harder for them to last long in the ring.</p><p>The biggest boxers in the world are those who have managed to strike a balance between size and skill. These boxers have honed their craft and have used their size to their advantage, becoming some of the most dominant fighters in the sport.</p><p>In this article, we will be discussing some of the biggest boxers in the world, their strengths and weaknesses, and what makes them stand out from the rest.

He is known for his incredible punching power, with over 40 of his wins coming by way of knockout. Wilder stands at 6'7" and weighs over 220 pounds, making him one of the biggest and most intimidating boxers in the sport.</p><h3>Nikolai Valuev</h3><p>Nikolai Valuev is a retired Russian heavyweight boxer who is known for his incredible size. At 7'0" and over 300 pounds, Valuev is one of the biggest boxers in the history of the sport. Despite his size, Valuev was surprisingly agile and was able to win multiple world titles in his career.</p><h3>Kubrat Pulev</h3><p>Kubrat Pulev is a Bulgarian heavyweight boxer who has held multiple European titles in the sport.
