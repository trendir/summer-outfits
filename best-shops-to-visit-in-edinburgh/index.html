If you don't mind crowds and want to experience the city at its liveliest, consider visiting during the summer months (June-August). However, if you want to avoid crowds and get better deals, consider visiting in the shoulder season (April-May or September-October).</p><h3>Q: Are there any local Scottish brands that I should look out for while shopping in Edinburgh?</h3><p>A: Yes! Edinburgh is home to a variety of Scottish brands that you won't find anywhere else.

If you're a non-EU resident and spend more than Â£30 in a single store, you're eligible for a VAT refund. Make sure to ask for a VAT refund form when you make your purchase, and present it at the airport when you leave the country.</p><h3>Q: Can I negotiate prices in Edinburgh shops?</h3><p>A: Generally, no. While negotiating prices might be common in some other parts of the world, it's not typically expected or accepted in Edinburgh shops.
