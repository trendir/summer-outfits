If you don't mind crowds and want to experience the city at its liveliest, consider visiting during the summer months (June-August). However, if you want to avoid crowds and get better deals, consider visiting in the shoulder season (April-May or September-October).</p><h3>Q: Are there any local Scottish brands that I should look out for while shopping in Edinburgh?</h3><p>A: Yes! Edinburgh is home to a variety of Scottish brands that you won't find anywhere else. Some of our favorites include Johnstons of Elgin (known for their cashmere products), Mackintosh (known for their raincoats), and Harris Tweed (known for their tweed fabrics).</p><h3>Q: Can I get VAT (Value Added Tax) refunds when shopping in Edinburgh?</h3><p>A: Yes. If you're a non-EU resident and spend more than £30 in a single store, you're eligible for a VAT refund. Make sure to ask for a VAT refund form when you make your purchase, and present it at the airport when you leave the country.</p><h3>Q: Can I negotiate prices in Edinburgh shops?</h3><p>A: Generally, no. While negotiating prices might be common in some other parts of the world, it's not typically expected or accepted in Edinburgh shops.
