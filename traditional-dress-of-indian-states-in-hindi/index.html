She would show me pictures of her wearing beautiful sarees and embroidered salwar kameez, and I was always fascinated by the intricate designs and vibrant colors. As I grew older, I started to appreciate the beauty of Indian clothing, and I began to explore the traditional dress of Indian states in Hindi.</p><p>One of my favorite traditional dresses is the saree, which is worn by women in many Indian states.

Sarees come in many different fabrics, such as silk, cotton, and chiffon, and they are adorned with beautiful embroidery and embellishments.</p><p>Another popular traditional dress is the salwar kameez, which is worn by women in many northern Indian states.
